Thank you all for your use of my previous scripts and I hope you enjoy this one. I finished it about 4 months ago,
but never released it, and tucked it away in my archives. I recently found it, made a few lat minute changes and
released it to you. I am on coder vacation.

NOTE: 10/07/2023 - Added the original version of this script. This script may or may not work in newer versions of mIRC. Perhaps in the
distant future I will re-release this mIRC script with up to date code.
